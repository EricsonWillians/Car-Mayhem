# Car-Mayhem
A Top-View 2D shooter.

#### Present features:

* Controllable player with the arrow keys and WASD.
* 4 aim directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT).
* Cartridge-based bulllet and fire system.
* Random enemy spawn and respawn.
* Bullet and actor collision detection.
* Scene management.

#### How to play it:

Just download the release folder and execute it on Windows (It's a x86 windows binary, should run normally). "Ah, but I'm on linux!" (Then you're probably a "hacker" already and in that case, just install the Allegro 5 library and compile the whole schmere).
